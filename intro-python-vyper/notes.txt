** The EVM

-> On clicking compile btn, we compile our code to machine readable code
-> Generally, we compile this in EVM (ethereum virtual machine)
-> EVM provides set of rules or a set of standards of what compiled smart contract should look like
-> in machine readable code
-> If anyone follow these rules, they are called as EVM compatible.

# Examples of EVM compatible chains -
1. Ethereum 2. Arbitrium 3. Optimism 4. Polygon 5. Zksync

Note - It's Important to check the code is compatible to environment/chain being deployed.
