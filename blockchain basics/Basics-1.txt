Bitcoin is the first protocols to use this technology called blockchain.
Bitcoin - A peer to peer electronic cash system
Bitcoin white paper was created by satoshi nakamoto
Bitcoin - called as superior digital store of value
Bitcoin has planet has certain amounts to buy & sell

Ethereum - extended Bitcoin features by vitalin buterin
Decentralized agreement - smart contract
smart contract - set of instructions executed in decentralized way without need of 
                centralized or 3rd party intermediary. These are codes, embodied on
                decentralized blockchain platforms.
Traditional agreement - are set of agreement bet 2 parties in written format, in paper 
                that can be altered easily.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum - bitcoin used as a store of value, Ethereum as store of value  
                 and a way to facilitate these decentralized agreements.
Problem - blockchain need real data to intergrate features in real life use case.  
          They cant read data from real world, oracle Problem         

Oracle - is any device that connects a deterministic blockchain with off-chain data.
        For keeping our data decentralized, we have to work with mutiple oracles,
        handle large computations. Hence, we need decentralized oracle.
        On-Chain + Off-chain = hybrid smart contract
        
Chainlink- decentralized oracle network

Web1: permissionless + open source + static content
Web2: permissioned web + dynamic content + companies run agreement on their servers
Web3: permissionless web + dynamic content, decentralized censorship resistant networks
      run your agreements and code.
      user owned ecosystems

Note - ### Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

As blockchains grow, they face scaling issues. Layer 2, or L2, solutions have been developed to address this. L2 solutions involve other blockchains hooking into the main blockchain, essentially allowing it to scale. There are two primary types of L2 solutions:

* **Optimistic Rollups:** eg. Optimism, Arbitrum
* **Zero-Knowledge Rollups:** eg. ZKsync, Polygon ZK EVM

1. **Layer 2**: Layer 2 solutions in web3 are technologies built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) 
                to improve its scalability and efficiency. These solutions handle transactions off the main chain, reducing congestion and fees, and then settle the final state on the main chain. _Example_: The Lightning Network for Bitcoin.
            
benefit of sc -
1. Decentralized
2. Transparency and flexibility
3. speed a d efficiency
4. Security and immutability ( to hack, if you have to take over half of codes)
5. counterparty risk removal
6. trust minimized agreements

note - many node operators runs blockchain

Transaction fee -> amount paid to the block producer for processing the transaction.
Gas price -> cost per unit of gas specified for the transaction in ether and gwei. 
            The higher the gas price, the higher the chances of getting included in
            the block.

note - when you send a transaction, there is node (minor or validator) depending on network you'r on
        who gets paid little bit of native currency of blockchain to process that transaction.

note - lets you'r a sending a transaction on Polygon network, they r paid in Maddock (native token of Polygon)
        toke = currency
        native token of L2 IS Ethereum

note - more complex transaction, more gas to pay
note - the more people send transaction at same time, the more expensive gas costs are-

Hash- a hash is a unique, fixed-length string that serves to identify any piece of data.
         When you input any kind of data into a hash function, it produces a hash.
         hash algo we use - SHA256

         a hash is a unique, fixed-length string that serves to identify any piece of data. 
         When you input any kind of data into a hash function, it produces a hash.

**Genesis Block:** This is the first block in a blockchain.
