BLOCKCHAIN ATTACKS -
### Blockchain Attacks

There are two major types of attacks that exist in the blockchain space.

* Sybil Attack - When a user creates a number of pseudo-anonymous accounts to try to influence a network.
* 51% attack - Occurs when a single entity possesses both the longest chain and majority network control. 
This would allow the entity to `fork` the chain and bring the network onto the entities record of events, effectively allowing them to validate anything.


note -
Blockchains are very democratic. The bigger a blockchain is, the more decentralized, the more secure it becomes.

Disadvantages of pow - Proof of Work does come with drawbacks. For example, Proof of Work consumes a LOT of electricity. 
When you have thousands of nodes all working as hard as they can to solve a block problem the energy consumption is HUGE and as such, so is the potential environmental impact

PROOF OF STAKE -

In contrast to trying to solve a block problem, Proof of Stake nodes put up some collateral that they are going to behave honestly aka they `stake`. 
If a node is found to be misbehaving, it's stake is slashed. This serves as a very effective sybil resistance mechanism because for each account, the validator needs to put up more stake and misbehaving risks losing all that collateral.

> In a Proof of Stake system, `miners` are known as `validators`. They aren't actually mining blocks, they're validating other nodes.


LAYER -1 AND LAYER -2
1. `Layer 1` solutions: This refers to base layer blockchain implementations like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
2. `Layer 2` solutions: These are applications added on top of a layer one, like [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) or [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/).

Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism are special in that they're trying to solve the problem of scalability. 
These protocols leverage something called `rollups`. We won't go too deep, but the idea is that the protocols bundle their transactions to be processed by a Layer 1.



##### L1, L2 and rollups

LAYER -1  ----------------


A **Layer 1 (L1)** blockchain is the base layer of the blockchain ecosystem, where nodes help the chain to reach consensus. 
It operates without any additional plugins and is often referred to as the _settlement layer_. Examples of L1 chains include Bitcoin, 
BNB Chain, Solana, and Avalanche. In this course, we primarily focus on Ethereum, which serves as the **hub** of the Ethereum ecosystem. Applications directly deployed on Ethereum, like Uniswap, are not considered L2s but rather dApps on L1.


LAYER -2 -------------------


A **Layer 2** is any application built on outside an L1 blockchain that _hooks back into it_. There are different types of Layer 2, 
for example **Chainlink**, a decentralized Oracle networks and event indexing networks like **The Graph**, which enable applications to access on-chain data. But the most popular type of L2 is the **rollup**, or **L2 chain**.


Rollups - 
**Rollups** are L2 scaling solutions that enable to increase the number of transactions on Ethereum by bundling multiple transactions into one, reducing gas costs.
advantages -
Rollups help solve the blockchain trilemma, which states that a blockchain can only achieve two out of three properties:
     _decentralization_, _security_, and _scalability_. In the case of Ethereum, **scalability** is sacrificed as it can only process approximately 15 transactions per second. Rollups, on the other hand, aim to enhance scalability without compromising security or decentralization.



WORING OF ROLLUPS -

1. When a user [submits a transaction](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle) to a rollup, an **operator** (a node or entity responsible for processing transactions)
     picks it up, bundles it with other transactions, compresses them, and submits the batch back to the L1 blockchain. This process allows for efficient handling of transactions 
     as gas costs associated with the transaction, are split among all the users that submitted the transactions in the batch.

2. There are two types of rollups, 
    Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge rollups. The main difference between the two lies in how each rollup verifies the validity of the transactions.
