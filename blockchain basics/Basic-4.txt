##### Centralized sequencers

- One of type of operators associated with rollups is a sequencers.
- refers to operators which is ordering transactions and 
- bundling them together
- in some rollups , sequencers are centralized and controlled by a 
- centralized entity, can lead to things like censorship
- where centralized entity is stopping some users transactions fromo being passed
- or an manipulate order of transactions
- blocked 

Major issue - If sequencers goes down, no one will able to do transactions at all.
So, these r problems with sequencers and hence zkSync came.
- and decentralizing the sequencers.

---------------------------------

##### Rollup stages
- are graded based on certain properties and given a stage.
- categorised based on Vitalix proposed milestones.

A Layer 2 (L2) chain's maturity is evaluated based on specific properties and categorized into **stages**.

***Rollup Stages

1. **Stage 0**: In this initial stage, the rollup's governance is largely in the hands of the operators and a security council, ensuring that critical decisions and actions are overseen by a _trusted group_. The open-source software allows for the reconstruction of the state from L1 data, ensuring transparency and accessibility. Users in this stage have an exit mechanism that allows them to leave the rollup within seven days. However, this often requires actions from an entity/operator.

2. **Stage 1**: In this stage, governance evolves to be managed by _smart contracts_, although the _security council_ still plays an important role (e.g. solving bugs). At this stage, the proof system becomes fully functional, enabling decentralized submission of validity proofs. The exit mechanism is improved, allowing users to exit independently without needing operator coordination.

3. **Stage 2**: In this final stage, the rollup achieves full decentralization with governance entirely managed by smart contracts, removing the need for operators or council interventions in everyday operations. The proof system at this stage is permissionless and the exit mechanism is also fully decentralized. The security council's role is now strictly limited to addressing any errors that occur on-chain, ensuring that the system remains fair without being overly reliant on centralized entities.


****
Currently, [Zksync Era](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/zksync-era) is operating as a `Stage 0` rollup. In the dedicated page on L2, we can find a risk analysis:

1. Data Availability**: refers to the ability to reconstruct the L2 state from L1 data, ensuring that anyone can verify and rebuild the L2 state if necessary.

2. State Validation**: involves verifying the legitimacy of a set of bundled transactions. For ZK Sync, this is done using zero-knowledge proofs through an algorithm known as PLONK (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge).

3. Sequencer Failure**: describes the ability to process transactions even if the sequencer is down. In ZK Sync, transactions can still be submitted to L1, though not necessarily enforced immediately.

* > 🗒️ **NOTE**
  >
  > The sequencer is the operator responsible for _ordering_ user transactions and often _batching_ them before committing them to Layer 1.

* Proposer Failure**: describes the ability to process transactions even if the proposer is down. In this case, ZK Sync will halt all withdrawals and transactions executions.

* Exit Window**: In the current ZK Sync stage, there is no window for exit during unwanted upgrades.
